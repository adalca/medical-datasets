# List of Medical (Imaging) Datasets
I maintain this list mostly as a personal braindump of interesting medical datasets, with a focus on medical imaging.   
Rather than try to group / cluster datasets, I'm going to try to maintain a set of keywords for each.  
See [commit log](https://github.com/adalca/medical-datasets/commits/master) for a list of additions over time.

Please feel free to contribute!

**Disclaimer**: please remember to solve real clinical problems ☺
